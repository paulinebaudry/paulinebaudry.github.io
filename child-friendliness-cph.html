    <h1>How child friendly is Copenhagen?</h1>
    <h2>A tool mapping child-friendliness in the Danish capital</h2>
    <h3>June 1, 2018</h3>
</div>
    <div id = 'text'>
    <p>Denmark is arguably one of the happiest nations in the world, ranking once again among the top countries of the <a href = "http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2018/"target="_blank">World Happiness Report</a>.
      A non-negligible contributor to the strength of the Danish 'hygge' mentality and model for happiness is that it is particularly child-oriented. </p>
    <p>However, the Danish population has also been growing in the past years, particularly in Copenhagen, with a yearly increase of 1.32% between 2011 and 2015.
      Higher population density can put pressure on child-friendliness within the urban structure: for instance, a study conducted by <a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705817329776"target="_blank">Li and Li (2017)</a> in China
      revealed that a city's child-friendliness decreases with higher density. Moreover, the lack of consideration of children in the design and planning of cities
      is an oft-mentioned criticism. It can hence be interesting to consider: how child-friendly really is Copenhagen?</p>

<p>More specifically, it can be interesting to assess the child-friendliness of the city's infrastructure as a partial indicator of how well Copenhagen tailors for
  needs of children in the urban context. The following tool maps data for some of the relevant infrastructure,  which is taken from the <a href = "https://data.kk.dk/"target="_blank">Copenhagen Open Data platform</a>.
  As childrenâ€™s activities and interests vary according to age, three age groups have been created, to which different variables have been assigned.
The maps in the first tab contain four categorical groups, which encompass important aspects influencing children's environment.
In the second tab, you will find a "Child-friendliness index", calculated based on the amount of occurences relative to the surface area of each school district. The environment variable is accounted for based on relative surface area, whereas the other data points are taken as counts.

  The maps were made using R and embedded below through a Shiny App. </p>

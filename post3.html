    <h2>A spatial analysis of the effect of safety on persisting gender gaps in cycling in New York City</h2>
    <h3>January 1, 2019</h3>

<p>Mobility is a defining factor of a well-functioning city, and safeguarding equal access to diverse modes of transportation is consequently a crucial aspect of city and transport planning. In particular, urban environments increasingly tailor for more active and sustainable means of moving around a city, of which cycling represents the prime example, given its historical existence and practicality. However, a major shortcoming is frequently observed in the practice of cycling, as a group representing half of the urban population is often undermined, namely, women. The gender gap in cycling is striking in several cities around the world, hence indicating the need for various policy measures and infrastructural improvements to encourage more women to cycle. In light of correcting this gender divide, it is important to understand the differences in cycling behaviours according to the gender of cyclists. More specifically, some differences may depend on the current state of cycling conditions, which can therefore be modified and improved. Literature identifies several potential reasons for lower female rates of cycling, including caring for children and taking care of household tasks, which remain mostly female occupations, and can impact the practicality of cycling, but also female perceptions of safety and related fears. The latter explanation can be more practically tackled, and thus forms an important focus of study. </p>
